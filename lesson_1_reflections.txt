How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It came up right away. Changes were obvious.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Easy way to keep track of changes and return to old versions when things fail.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You have no control over the autosave but less human error due to poor commit practice.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is build for developers more so than other systems like google docs. These
    are made to function with individial sheets or wordprocessor documents.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Find the log of changes and their notes then compare them to prior versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It was rather simple, I can not wait to try it on my own files.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    pfff...yeah!
